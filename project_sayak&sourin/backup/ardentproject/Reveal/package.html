  <p>Creatinine and electrolytes level help to detect kidney disorders. increased BUN level indicates kidney disease, heart failure, gout and pregnancy diseases. urea is the principle waste product of protein catabolism. BUN is most commonly measured in the diagnosis and treatment of certain renal and metabolic diseases. increased BUN concentration may result from increased production of urea due to (1) diet or excessive destruction of cellular proteins as occurs in massive infection and fevers, (2) reduced renal perfusion resulting from dehydration or heart failure, (3) nearly all types of kidney disease, and (4) mechanical obstruction to urine excretion such as is caused by stones, tumors, infection, or stricture. decreased urea levels are less frequent and occur primarily in advanced liver disease and in over hydration.</p>
